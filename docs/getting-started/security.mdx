# Security Guidelines for Data Integration Implementations

Even if the technologies leveraged in your integration solution can be
considered secure, there are still many security risks in data integration,
especially during implementation. With support from Digital Square, we have
therefore developed a **Security Guidebook for Data Integration
Implementations**.

Since 2014, we at Open Function Group (the primary custodians of OpenFn) have
helped implement nearly 100 data integration solutions for over 45 NGO and
government partners around the world. Through our engagements with security
teams at different partners, our own research and development, consultations
with security experts internal and external, and partnerships with other
communities of practice, we have developed a strong understanding of security
best practices and considerations for data integration projects that we would
like to share with the wider digital development community.

**This Guidebook aims to help digital implementers in the Digital Public Good
and Global Goods communities better understand security risks and presents 23
best practices for the various implementation phases of data integration
projects.** It also links to some open-sourced OFG resources our team uses in
our own implementation process for OpenFn projects.

You can find a complete list of the 23 best practices on this page below.

<h3>Secure Data Integration: 23 Implementation Best Practices</h3>
<h4>Core Tenets</h4>
<ol> 
 <li>Understand relevant policies specific to data sharing, storage, and protection</li>
 <li>Only extract & transfer essential data points</li>
 <li>Document, document, document</li> 
</ol>
<h4>Analyze & Plan</h4>
<ol start="4"> 
 <li>Don’t take API security for granted</li>  
 <li>Budget time for security testing</li>    
</ol>

<h4>Design</h4>
<ol start="6"> 
<li>Resource: Mapping specification template</li>
<li>Resource: Architecture data flow diagram</li>
<li>Resource: Project Security Configuration & Go-Live Checklist</li>
<li>Consider idempotency, unique identifiers, & “upsert” operations to ensure data integrity</li>
<li>Design for failures & transaction reprocessing</li>
<li>Consider data validation</li>
</ol>
<h4>Build</h4>
<ol start="12"> 
<li>Use change tracking & version control</li>
<li>Encrypt where possible</li>
<li>Use strong authentication;  don’t talk to strangers</li>
<li>Authorization scopes to limit access</li>
<li>Log transactions for activity monitoring & control what information is logged</li>
</ol>
<h4>Deploy</h4>
<ol start="17"> 
<li>Test again, especially credentials, before deployment</li>
<li>Train users and system administrators on integration security</li>
<li>Review your security requirements again before go-live</li>
<li>Determine point of contacts for reporting security issues</li> 
</ol>
<h4>Ongoing Monitoring & Management</h4>
<ol start="21"> 
<li>Consider Governance models for ongoing management & changing requirements</li>
<li>Train partners on change management</li>
<li>Have a strategy for access management</li>
</ol>
