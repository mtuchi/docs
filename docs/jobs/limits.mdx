title: Limits
---

Both microservice and OpenFn.org (the iPaaS) have some pre-configured limits to
ensure smooth operation. Read below for a detailed explanation of those defaults
and how to adjust the limits.

<Tip>

If you don't feel like reading much, here's the tl;dr:

1. Don't send more than `8MB` to the `/inbox` API in a single request.
2. Make sure your `expression.js` and your `state.json` don't total more than
   `10MB` when you _start_ or _finish_ a run.
3. Keep memory usage below `512MB` _during_ the run.

</Tip>

## NodeVM memory limits

The default memory limit for a Node process is `512MB` and unless you've
customized it for use on core or have agreed to a high-memory plan on
OpenFn.org, job runs will be killed by Node (`JavaScript heap out of memory`)
when they reach that threshold.

### Increase memory limit for an individual execution

For a `1GB` limit for an individual job, use:

```sh
node --max-old-space-size=1024 core execute ...arguments
```

### Increase memory limit for all jobs on that machine

For a `4GB` limit for all jobs, set an environment variable with:

```sh
export NODE_OPTIONS=--max_old_space_size=4096
```

## Request body limit on inboxes

The maximum size of the JSON body accepted on the `/inbox/your-uuid` endpoint is
`8MB`. Note that payloads should be kept below this limit in order to ensure
that [Job state limits](#job-state-limits) are not hit when a subsequent job run
is executed.

<Note>

If you're using OpenFn for bulk data processing/periodic batch jobs, you can
either reconfigure these limits on your microservice deployment or contact
enterprise@openfn.org to have special provisions made for your OpenFn.org
project.

</Note>

## Job state limits

When a job is to be sent for processing the total size of all job artifacts
(your job `expression` and the initial `state`) cannot exceed `10MB`. In other
words, your code (`expression.js`) plus your data and configuration
(`state.json`) cannot exceed `10MB` in total.

Similarly, when state is saved to cloud storage/disk _after_ execution there is
a `10MB` limit to the size of a job's final `state`.

If you're dealing with large amounts of data you've got to (a) keep your total
memory use below `512MB` during execution and (b) clean up state so that
whatever you're passing to the next job, whether via FLOW or via saved state for
a CRON job, remains below `10MB`.

Sometimes, this necessitates streaming data from A -> B in the same job. Other
times it will necessitate storing data as local variables and then posting data
to your inbox in chunks before cleaning up state.
