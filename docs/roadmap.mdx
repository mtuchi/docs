## Visit the public [documentation roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/OpenFn/projects/1?card_filter_query=repo%3Aopenfn%2Fdocs) on github.

We're constantly working to improve the documentation on OpenFn, particularly
around the open source integration toolkit. Visit the documentation roadmap on
Github to see what we're working on.

actual docs issues on Github.

## Planned Sections/Enhancements

### Foundational Concepts

A page or set of pages that reviews concepts that are essentially prerequisite
to using OpenFn or another interoperability platform.

### The anatomy of an integration (title subject to change)

Envisioned as a primarily visual page that outlines the constituent parts of
every integration to equip OpenFn users with a solid grounding of what an
integration really is

### Integrating using OpenFn

Either a subpage of the structure page or its own page subsequent to; this maps
the foundational concepts above to jobs, triggers, runs, etc. We will only
introduce OpenFn-specific terminology after we establish a common frame of
reference. In some ways this is just an edit of the current Getting Started
page.

### What Does it Mean to be Ready?

Detail our OFG consulting team’s implementation process, including the various
places that data mapping is referenced to do a step-by-step “pre-job-writing”
walkthrough

### Creation of documentation/tutorial “pathways”

Presenting guides and for new users and new devs from existing documentation
resources to flatten the learning curve

### Quickstart

Rewrite to be dev-centered; should read as a page for users who understand the
above already and are ready to dive into technical setup

### Project walk-through

Revise to incorporate the below app-specific tutorials in a cohesive manner

### How to integrate CommCare with Salesforce

The Project walkthrough, but specific to these two tools.

### How to integrate DHIS2 and CommCare

### How to integrate Kobo Toolbox and a custom Postgres database
