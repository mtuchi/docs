## OpenFn Roadmap

This page details the planned roadmaps for the key products in the OpenFn
product suite. This includes OpenFn/`Lightning`, `Adaptors`, and `Docs`.

### Key for the Roadmap `Status` Values

| Status Value  | Definition                                                              |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Not started` | Issue in the backlog but still in need of being designed and scoped out |
| `Planned`     | Scoped and ready to be picked up by an engineer                         |
| `In dev`      | Currently being worked on by an engineer                                |

### Lightning Roadmap

OpenFn/Lightning is the fully open-source workflow automation platform at the
core of the OpenFn Digital Public Good (learn more about the product
[here](/documentation/about-lightning)).

| 1. Delete a project (as a project owner or a superuser)                | In dev       | Q2 '23              | [Github issue 757](https://github.com/OpenFn/Lightning/issues/757) & [issue 746](https://github.com/OpenFn/Lightning/issues/746)                                                    | Project owners can delete a project. This will schedule the project for deletion after the configured time period. Also, superusers can schedule a project for deletion, cancel a project's deletion and delete a project immediately.                  |
| 2.

### Adaptors Roadmap

OpenFn's open-source adaptors can connect any application, including web APIs,
databases, and even raw data files, enabling interoperability with any
information system ([read more](/adaptors/)). Adaptors, alongside OpenFn's
workflow engine, enable automated workflows that cut across digital systems.
